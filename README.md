## Questions

2. What are your career goals?
   - My goal is to become a Quantitative Analyst/Trader, an Algo Trader. An extremely successful one at that. 


3. Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

   - I decided to choose FinTech becasue I have always been interested in it but I never took the time to sit down and research it. I've always loved finance but never had the opportunity to learn it. Then with this big technology boom and my love for technology COMBINED with my new found availibility because of COVID-19, I felt what better time?
